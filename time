 /*Create a class called Time that has separate int member data for hours, minutes and
seconds. One constructor should initialize this data to 0, and another should
initialize it to fixed values. A member function should display it in 11:59:59 format.
A member function named add() should add two objects of type time passed as
arguments. A main ( ) program should create two initialized values together, leaving
the result in the third time variable. Finally it should display the value of this third
variable*/
